        <h2>Introduction to C++</h2><br>
        <p>C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language by Bjarne Stroustup in the early 1980s. C++ is widely used for system/software development,<br>
            game development, and applications that require high performance.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        <h3>Features of C++ </h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Object-Oriented:C++ supports object-oriented programming (oop) principles, allowing for the allowing for the creation of classes and objects. This helps in organising code and promoting reusability.</li>
                <li>Rich standard library: C++ provides a rich set of built-in functions and library, which can significantly reduce the development time. </li>
                <li>Performance: C++ offers low-level memory manipulation, allowing developers to optimize performance-critical applications. </li>
                <li>Probability:C++ programs can be compiled and runned on various platforms without significant modifications. </li>
                <li>Compatability with C: C++ is compatible with C, allowing for the integration of existing C code.</li>
            </ol><br>
        <pre style="background-color: aqua;">
            <code>
                #include &lt;iostream&gt;
                using namespace std;
                int main(){
                    count &lt;&lt; "Hello, world !"  &lt;&lt; endl;
                    return 0;
                }
            </code>
        </pre><br>

        </p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>#include &lt;iostream&lt; This includes the input/output stream library, allowing the use of count for output and cin for input.</li>
            <li>using namespace std;: This line allows access to the standard library features without prefixing them with std;: </li>
            <li>int main(): The entry point of every c++ program.</li>
            <li>count: used for outputting to the console.</li>
            <li>return 0;: Indicates that the program has ended successfully.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Applications of C++</h3><br>
        <ol>
            <li>System software: C++ is used in developing operating systems and system-level applications.</li>
            <li>Game Development: Many Game engines and Games are written in C++ due to its performance and control over system resources.</li>
            <li>Embedded systems: C++ is often used in programming embedded systems for devices like smartphones, appliances, and automotive systems.</li>
            <li>Web Browsers: Many Web Browsers, like Google chrome, use C++ for performance-critical components.</li>

        <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
        <p>What is an array ?</p>
        <p>An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, which allows for efficient data management and manipulation.</p><br>
        <img src="./Arrays.webp" alt="Arrays in C++">

        
        <h3>Characterisics of array</h3><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed size: The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed.</li>
            <li>Indexed: Each element in an array is accessed using an index, which typically starts from zero. </li>
            <li>Homogeneous elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type, such as integers, floats, or strings.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Types of Array</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>One-Dimentional Arrays: A linear list of elements, where each element can be accessed by a single index.
                           <ul><li>Example:int numbers[5]; (stores 5 integers)</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Multi-Dimensional arrays:Arrays with more than one dimension, commonly used for matrices and tables.
                           <ul><li>Example: int matrix [3][3]; (a 3*3 matrix of intergers)</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dynamic Arrays: Arrays that can change size during program execution, typically implemented using data stuctures like lists.</li>

        <h2>Introduction to Trees</h2>
        <pre>
            A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a single root node at the top , from which all other nodes branch out. Nodes can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node can
            further brach out into more nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships , such as file systems or organisational structures .

            <li>AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the right and left subtrees is at most one. </li>
            <li>Red-blank Tree: A balanced binary search tree with an additional property that ensures the tree remains during the insertions and deletions. </li>
            <li>N-ary Tree: A tree in which a node can have atmost N children. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Introduction to Graphs</h3>
        <pre>
            A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connects pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships or connections between various entities and are fundamental in computer science 
            for modelling complex networks, such as social networks, transportation systems, and communication networks.
        </pre>
        <img src="./Graphs (1).webp" alt="Graphs in C++">
        <h3>Characteristics of Graphs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>various nodes: The fundamental units of a graph, representing entities in the graphs.</li>
            <li>Edges: connections between pairs of vertices, which can be derected (one-way) or undirected (two-way)</li>
            <li>Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. For directed graphs, a vertex can have an in-degree (number of incomming edges) and an out-degree (number of outgoing edges).</li>
            <li>Path: A sequence of edges that connects a sequenc of vertices.</li>
            <li>Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of graphs</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph where the edges have a direction, indicatin the relationship flows from one vertex to another</li>
            <li>Undirected graph: A graph where the edges donot have a direction, indicating the two way relationship between vertices.</li>
            <li>Weighted Graph: A graph where each edge has an associated weight or cost, often used to represent distances or costs in a network.</li>
            <li>Unweighted Graph: A Graph where all edges are treated equally, without any weights.</li>
            <li>Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains at least one cycle.</li>
            <li>Acyclic graphs: A graph that doesnot contain any cycles, such as a tree.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Applicatiions of Graph</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Social networks: Graphs are used to model relationshipsand interactions between individuals or entities in social media platforms.</li>
            <li>Transportation networks: Graphs represent roads, intersections and routes in transportation systems, helping optimize travel and logistics.</li>
            <li>Web page link analysis: The structure of web can be represented as a graph , with web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges, enabling search engines to analyze and rank pages. </li>
