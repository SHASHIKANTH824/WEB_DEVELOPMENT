<!--use "." symbol for representing class and use "#" symbol for representing ID. for example , enter p.first to get <p class="first"></p>
and enter p#first to get <p id="first"></p> . -->

    <!--There will two key-value attributes name & class , these two attributes are used to store the information entered in the input box . the value attribute is used to represent the data entered in input box and this name is used to come behind this value like name = value .
    Ex: Name="fname"
        value="random"
        then server will read it as fname = random. this keyvalue attributes are used to make difference between the same two Names & values. 
        using of value attribute is optional. if don't use it also the data entered in input box will be automatically assigned as value in the server base.
        if we use value attribute then the data mentioned in the value attribute will be automatically displayed in the input box same as the placeholder attribute.-->
